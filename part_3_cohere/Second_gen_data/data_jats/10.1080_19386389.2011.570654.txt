Title: An Analysis of Problems in Metadata Records
Abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Metadata plays an important role in digital libraries. But to be useful, metadata records must be problem free. When problems are present in the metadata, resources are not correctly represented and users are not able to reap the benefits of metadata. To minimize, if not eliminate, such problems, it is essential to understand the kinds of problems that can occur in metadata records. In this paper, problems found in metadata records as reported in the literature are compared and analyzed. It is found that five categories of metadata problems can be identified. These are the problems of Incorrect Values, Incorrect Elements, Missing Information, Information Loss, and Inconsistent Value Representation. Given that these problems are detrimental to the services that can be provided by metadata, preventive or corrective measures need to be put in place so as to ensure that the benefits derived from using metadata balance the costs and efforts spent in the creation of metadata records.
