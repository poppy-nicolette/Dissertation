    "## purpose:\n",
    "- A discipline specific corpus as a sample of DOIs will be used. The BtS dataset is a good source for this as it is literature from which expert review, if needed, can be provided. \n",
    "- A source from Part 2 will guide decision on where to get metadata. \n",
    "- Characterization using methods from Part 1 will be applied to the metadata.\n",
    "- Characterizations will be mapped to configuration decisions for a RAG application.\n",
    "- Cohere Playground will be used to develop code to run in this notebook. \n",
    "- Explore tokenization options, explore retreivers, and explore how cited by can be used for ranking. \n",
    "- Chunking options for either BoW or embedding approach will be explored.\n",
    "- Explore BoW approach using TF-IDF, BM25, and sentence embedding approach using SciBERT.\n",
    "- Explore cited_by counts for reranking. \n",
    "- Expore results using precision, recall, and F1 scores. compare all configurations. \n",
    "- visualize results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data collection\n",
    "- original source of data: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14302591.\n",
    "- [ ] get DOIs, run through cleaning script found in jupyter Notebook DOI_errors.ipynb (may want to compress this down to one function except for manual inspection items. )\n",
    "    - [ ] Or just use v2 cleaned data here:/Users/poppyriddle/Documents/Github/BtS_data/dataset/v2/publications_v2.txt\n",
    "- [ ] send to OpenAlex REST API for works: select title,abstract,cited-by-count\n",
    "- [ ] clean title\n",
    "- [ ] reconstruct and clean abstract \n",
