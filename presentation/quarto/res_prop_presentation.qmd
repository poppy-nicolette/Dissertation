## Presentation overview

-   Part 2: Comparing sources
-   Part 3: RAG in action
-   Concluding thoughts and questions

# Introduction

## Background {.scrollable}
::: notes
Notes on abstracts and titles
:::

Abstracts as summaries, though limited in depth

Many abstracts, might provide a more holistic answer

Systematic review well known process

Abstracts may be available when the paper is [paywalled]{.yellow}


## What is RAG?
Retrieval-augmented generation

## Proof of concept {.scrollable}
Summer of 2024 experimented using abstracts as a source of RAG applications

## Proposition
[If we use metadata as a knowledge source in RAG, is metadata quality a problem?]{.yellow .absolute left="20%" top="30%" right="20%"}

## Past research 
::: notes
past studies have examined coverage, completeness, accuracy, but not content.
:::

### [OpenAlex quality]{.yellow}
- Culbert et al. (2024): shared corpus of OpenAlex and other databases<br>
- Delgado-Quiros & Ortega (2024): metadata in Crossref and OpenAlex<br>
- Alonso-Alverez & van Eck (2024): analysis of OpenAlex<br>

### [RAG and metadata]{.yellow}
- Braun et al. (2024): Linzbach et al. (2023): query types<br>
- Kang & Kim (2023): metadata in RAG<br>
- Hayashi et al. (2024): metadata as document source<br>
- Agarwal et al. (2024): bibliometric abstracts from Semantic Scholar for kw extraction<br>

### [Perturbations in RAG]{.yellow}
- F. Shi et al.(2023): irrelevant information in contexts<br>
- Cho et al. (2024): typos affecting retrieval performance<br>


## 3 areas should be explored:

1.  metadata characterization
2.  metadata source
3.  evaluate characteristic impact through case study

## Gaps addressed

-   Lack of characterization of title and abstract metadata

-   Metadata source: compares two sources for effects of aggregation and transformation

-   evidence for bibliometric metadata directly as a document source in RAG

## Framework

![](images/framework.svg){fig-align="center" }



# Part 1: Characterize metadata {.scrollable}

## Characterize metadata from Crossref {.scrollable}

What are the characteristics of textual metadata from a registration agency, such as Crossref?

![](images/part_1.svg){fig-align="center" }

## Example: {.scrollable}

Abstract metadata from <https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1103/physrevd.110.036015>

![](images/abstract.png){fig-align="center"}

Or, another example from <https://api.crossref.org/works/10.33024/hjk.v15i1.3791>:

![](images/abstract2.png){fig-align="center"}

Or one that contains geometric shapes, from <https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1108/eemcs-04-2022-0108>

Three datasets of 45 works containing the DOI, the title, and the abstract

-   Analyze results from the retriever:

    -   precision

    -   recall

    -   balanced accuracy

    -   document scores

-   Analyze results from the generator model:

# Summary

## Purpose:

[[Bibliometric metadata]{.yellow} can be used as a [source of external knowledge]{.yellow} in RAG, however, it is unknown what kind of errors, where these are found, and how they may impact RAG outcomes.]{.absolute left="20%" top="30%" right="20%"}

## Benefits

[This study should help us understand how [characteristic]{.yellow} from Part 1 and how a [data source]{.yellow} from Part 2, may [impact retrieval and generation]{.yellow} in a RAG application.]{.absolute left="20%" top="30%" right="20%"}

##  

[Additionally, it also provides a handy set of [patterns]{.yellow} that can be used to [identify]{.yellow} such [problems]{.yellow} before using the metadata, or for the purpose of cleaning.]{.absolute left="20%" top="30%" right="20%"}

##  

[It [characterizes metadata]{.yellow} from Crossref and OpenAlex in a way that has not been done before.]{.absolute left="20%" top="30%" right="20%"}

##  

[Introduces the [Crossref XML API]{.yellow} as part of analyzing metadata completeness and accuracy.]{.absolute left="20%" top="30%" right="20%"}

##  

[It contributes to research on the [effect of perturbations]{.yellow} in embedding and generation models.]{.absolute left="20%" top="30%" right="20%"}

##  

[Raised my own skills in [Python]{.yellow}, knowledge of how [search and retrieval]{.yellow} is changing, how [LLMs]{.yellow} works and their limitations.]{.absolute left="20%" top="30%" right="20%"}

# Thank you!

And now, its time for questions.

# Sneak peek
Who wants to see some results?

## Ok, here's what actually happened:

1.  Part 1 was coded more than once to get consistency.

2.  Part 2 was easy, yet important to [confirm prior research]{.yellow}.

3.  Licensing information is a real [train wreck]{.magenta} and would require more time and expertise.

4.  I created two RAG applications:

    -   One uses [closed models]{.yellow} from Cohere - [I got a research grant!]{.blue}

    -   One uses [open models]{.yellow} for embedding: SciBERT and Specter.

5.  I reran the original test with different configurations of open and closed models:
    with [multilingual capability]{.yellow}, 
    with [only English]{.yellow}, and
    compared [word embedding]{.yellow} to [sentence embedding]{.yellow}.
