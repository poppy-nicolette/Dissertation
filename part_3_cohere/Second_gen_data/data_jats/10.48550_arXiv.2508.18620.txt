Title: Investigating Document Type, Language, Publication Year, and Author Count Discrepancies Between OpenAlex and Web of Science
Abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Bibliometrics, whether used for research or research evaluation, relies on large multidisciplinary databases of research outputs and citation indices. The Web of Science (WoS) was the main supporting infrastructure of the field for more than 30 years until several new competitors emerged. OpenAlex, a bibliographic database launched in 2022, has distinguished itself for its openness and extensive coverage. While OpenAlex may reduce or eliminate barriers to accessing bibliometric data, one of the concerns that hinders its broader adoption for research and research evaluation is the quality of its metadata. This study aims to assess metadata quality in OpenAlex and WoS, focusing on document type, publication year, language, and number of authors. By addressing discrepancies and misattributions in metadata, this research seeks to enhance awareness of data quality issues that could impact bibliometric research and evaluation outcomes.</jats:p>
