Tensile tests were carried out to investigate the effect of the CEF on the true stress–strain curve, yield strength, elastic modulus, and other mechanical properties of the TC2 titanium alloy. Bending tests assisted by CEF were also performed to investigate the effect of different parameters of the CEF on bending force, spring-back, bending fillet radius, and microstructure of TC2 titanium. The results demonstrate that compared to the process under a single-temperature field, the CEF can reduce yield strength, elastic modulus, bending force, bending fillet, and the spring-back angle, which shows that the CEF can further increase the high-temperature softening effect of TC2 titanium. Furthermore, this effect becomes more remarkable when ultrasonic vibration energy increases. As a result, the formability of titanium alloy can be improved.</jats:p>	en	('vor', 'https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/')	3	https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/14/23/7192

Social impairment, verbal communication impairment, and behavioral impairment are the three conditions for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, according to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. According to relevant statistics, about 1 in 100 children is now diagnosed with autism, and their rehabilitation treatment is also valued by people from all walks of life. In the rehabilitation training of autistic children, it is found that the rehabilitation training of autistic children should pay attention to the role of parents and family environment. It is crucial that parents receive systematic training and act as partners in the development of the intervention plan. Research shows that a specific structured education and skills training program for parents of children with autism can be beneficial in improving behavioral problems, functional communication, and symptoms of autism in children with autism. To this end, this paper has completed the following work: Secondly, a portion of the systematic training of CA parents is discussed, followed by an explanation of the structure and principles of BPNN. Finally, the BPNN is utilized to create a model for assessing the impact of systematic parent instruction on CA. The experimental findings suggest that the proposed BPNN outperforms the competition.</jats:p>	en	('unspecified', 'https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/')	0	https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2022/7746374/

               <jats:p>The decreasing number of family/friend caregivers available to help the rising number of older adults is creating a critical family care gap. For this reason, there is a growing need for interventions that reduce family/friend caregiving time. We systematically reviewed five electronic databases to identify randomized trials, case control, quasi-experimental, and cross-sectional studies that evaluated a modifiable element that could be targeted for interventions with care recipients 65+ and/or their family/friend caregivers and reported on an outcome of time spent caregiving. We excluded studies without a comparison, broadly defined. The initial search included 1,812 unique records. Following abstract and title screening 311 full-texts were reviewed. Fifty-five studies published between the years of 1990 and 2019 met inclusion criteria. Studies predominantly focused on care recipients with dementia (58%) and were largely conducted in western countries (91%). The categories of interventions reviewed included pharmaceuticals (25%), public long-term care financing (7%), case management (7%), care setting (16%), technology (7%), multi-component interventions (9%), skills building (15%), additional formal expertise/care (9%), and other (5%), with one study falling into multiple categories. Pharmaceuticals, case management, care setting, and multi-component interventions demonstrated promising evidence to reduce family/friend caregiving time. Methodologically, studies were inconsistent in measurement and ascertainment of caregiving time. Given the public health concerns of reduced availability of family/friend caregivers for older persons in the upcoming decades, caregiving interventions should consider measurements of caregiving time as key outcomes.</jats:p>"	en	('vor', 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/')	2	https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article/4/Supplement_1/350/6035396

            The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–localized stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is the core adaptor for the pathogenic-DNA–triggered innate response. Aberrant activation of STING causes autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, raising the concern about how STING is finely tuned during innate response to pathogenic DNAs. Here, we report that the transmembrane domain (TM)–containing ER-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM13 (tripartite motif containing 13) is required for restraining inflammatory response to pathogenic DNAs. TRIM13 deficiency enhances pathogenic-DNA–triggered inflammatory cytokine production, inhibits DNA virus replication, and causes age-related autoinflammation. Mechanistically, TRIM13 interacts with STING via the TM and catalyzes Lys

            -linked polyubiquitination of STING, leading to decelerated ER exit and accelerated ER-initiated degradation of STING. STING deficiency reverses the enhanced innate anti-DNA virus response in TRIM13 knockout mice. Our study delineates a potential strategy for controlling the homeostasis of STING by transmembrane ER-associated TRIM13 during the pathogenic-DNA–triggered inflammatory response.

The system provides essential features aimed at effectively addressing management needs, including real-time room availability monitoring, tenant payment tracking, and comprehensive data management. Key features such as room booking, electronic payment processing, and tenant data management have been successfully implemented, offering ease of use for both the kos owners and tenants. With real-time room availability tracking, owners can easily monitor room stock without needing manual checks. The electronic payment feature streamlines transactions, while tenant data management maintains organized and essential information. The research findings indicate that applying information technology to small-to-medium scale kos management effectively addresses longstanding challenges, particularly those related to inefficient, error-prone manual processes. This system not only supports Kos Yani in daily operations but also has the potential to serve as a model for similar applications in the broader room rental sector. With the increasing demand for digitalization in Indonesia, this system plays a critical role in accelerating digital transformation within the kos management sector, contributing significantly to the development of more modern and structured property management. As a result, this solution offers promising potential for adapting to various types of rental properties, paving the way for a more streamlined and responsive rental management experience across the industry.</jats:p>	NA	('unspecified', 'https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0')	0	https://melekit-if.uwks.ac.id/melekit/article/view/340

Many have contested the scientific consensus that masks are an effective method to prevent and slow the spread of COVID-19 infections, often along explicitly political lines. Here, we investigate specifically how Twitter users engaging in arguments about mask-wearing invoke scientific principles to argue against masks. We further analyze the sources that these users cite to support their claims. Using a qualitative approach drawing from constructivist grounded theory, we show how these users work to defend the legitimacy of their claims and their external sources by selectively exploiting rhetorical values of scientific endeavour. We analogize their work to the process of scientific boundary-work, in which actors consciously manipulate the boundary between science and not-science for personal and political gain.</jats:p>	NA	(None, None)	2	https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/spir/article/view/12143

               <jats:p>Limiting the global warming impact requires a drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) to reach a zero-carbon growth by 2050. Against this backdrop, turbomachinery designers are asked to develop more compact, efficient, and reliable machines. The research focuses on developing machines able to reduce energy losses and overall footprint, thus improving power plants efficiency and operability. To this end, expander-compressors (EC) seem to play a key role in the energy transition and appear a promising technology for high-density plants, especially together with hydrogen (H2) or supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) as working fluid. However, when operating conditions changes, a reduction in machine efficiency may be expected, with a consequent degradation of the overall system performance. In order to optimize the operation of the power plant, it is crucial to understand how the variation of the expander-compressor behavior affects the working conditions of the other components of the plant. In this perspective, a fast and reliable way to estimate the EC performance at different operating conditions is necessary. Although the scientific literature shows several studies on mean-line approaches for expanders and centrifugal compressors, the joint use of 1D models with artificial neural networks (ANN) for ECs combined machine is still overlooked. To fill this gap, the prediction of artificial intelligence (AI)-based performance maps is proposed in this work. The tool has been tested in a case study based on a real EC. Results showed a rapid evaluation of EC efficiency while varying the operating conditions.</jats:p>"	NA	('vor', 'https://www.asme.org/publications-submissions/publishing-information/legal-policies')	0	https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings/GT2024/88087/V12DT35A026/1204848

Objectives: Evaluate the performance of possessors in the MMSE (Mini-mental State Examination) and MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), evaluating the influence of education on the performance of the participants. Methods: This is a cross-sectional, descriptive study with 33 participants without cognitive complaints. These were people aged 40 years or more, and at least four years of schooling. Data were formed in SPSS (v.23), using Spearman’s correlation coefficient (CS). Results: The population is predominantly composed of women (87.8%), with a mean age of 58 years (SD = ± 9.5), and education of 11.7 years (SD = ± 4.2 years). The median performance on the MMSE was 25 points (95%CI = 24.5-26.4) and, of these, 75.8% had a value equal to or greater than 24 points. At the same time, the median score in the MoCA was 20 points (95%CI = 18.6-21.7) and 18.2% of those evaluated scored equal to or greater than 26 points. As for the influence of education, there was a correlation for both tools (MMSE: CS = 0.457; p = 0.008; MoCA: CS = 0.556; p = 0.001). Regarding age, there was a correlation with MMSE performance (CS = 0.368; p = 0.035). Conclusion: MoCA and MEEM are correlated with the length of formal education.

               <jats:p>Maximization of the turbocharger efficiency is fundamental to the reduction of the internal combustion engine back-pressure. Specifically, in turbochargers with a variable geometry turbine (VGT), energy losses can be induced by the aerodynamic profile of both the nozzle vanes and the turbine blades. Although appropriate considerations on material limits and structural performance of the turbine wheel are monitored in the design and aero-mechanical optimization phases, in these stages, fatigue phenomena might be ignored. Fatigue occurrence in VGT wheels can be categorized into low and high cycle behaviors. The former would be induced by the change in turbine rotational speed in time, while the latter would be caused by the interaction between the aerodynamic excitation and blades resonating modes.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>In this paper, an optimized turbine stage, including unique nozzle vanes design and turbine blades profile, has been assessed for high cycle fatigue (HCF) behavior. To estimate the robustness of the turbine wheel under several powertrain operations, a procedure to evaluate HCF behavior has been developed. Specifically, the HCF procedure tries to identify the possible resonances between the turbine blades frequency of vibrations and the excitation order induced by the number of variable vanes. Moreover, the method evaluates the turbine design robustness by checking the stress levels in the component against the limits imposed by the Goodman law of the material selected for the turbine wheel. In conclusion, both the VGT design and the HCF approach are experimentally assessed.</jats:p>"	NA	('vor', 'https://www.asme.org/publications-submissions/publishing-information/legal-policies')	0	https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings/GT2020/84195/Virtual,%20Online/1095127

              <jats:p>This chapter focuses on portraits of children in three photographic picturebooks from the German Democratic Republic
                (GDR). While these picturebooks draw largely on modernist photography in the postwar period, they also react sensitively to
                ideological demands from the official state authorities. To demonstrate this influence, this chapter exemplifies that these photobooks
                represent different aesthetic and ideological strategies. While <jats:italic>Bullermax</jats:italic> (<jats:xref>1964</jats:xref>) by Edith Rimkus and Horst Beseler is an exemplar of a poetic strategy and <jats:italic>Matti im Wald</jats:italic> (Matti in the
                Forest, <jats:xref>1966</jats:xref>) by the same couple represents a realistic strategy, <jats:italic>Kleiner Bruder
                  Staunemann</jats:italic> (Little Brother Marveling Man, <jats:xref>1966</jats:xref>) by Hans Hüttner and Lotti Ortner
                stands for a propagandistic strategy. The chapter analyzes the inherent socialist values of the three books by stressing the idea of
                the curious socialist child and the effects of montage.</jats:p>"	en	(None, None)	0	https://benjamins.com/catalog/clcc.17.10kum

The imagery is rich: lack of lucidity or awareness is absence of something vital, and this results in demise. And there is no safeguard. The chapter argues that all the action (that is, life) taking place within the various lyrical narratives offered on the album is consumed by the specter of death. The chapter positions Lamar as an antihero whose challenge to the illusion of the distinction of life versus death is positioned against the heroic view expressed in Eminem's “Stan.” The latter is an effort to pretend that heroism is a safeguard for life, rendering it distinctive.</jats:p>	en	(None, None)	0	https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/3299/chapter/8598363/The-Antihero

A total of 119 post-primary students took part in the pilot trial across Ireland. Data was collected via feedback questionnaires, systematic observations and pre and post-test surveys. Results indicate that this astronomy board game significantly enhances students' knowledge of astronomy concepts and perceptions of scientists. Furthermore, teachers showed positive attitudes towards this approach for teaching astronomy. Additionally, the game was demonstrated as a useful learning tool and as an activity to promote social skills. The findings offer a promising basis for further exploration of the integration of game-based approaches to physics education to promote active participation and interaction, balancing the learning objectives with play. </jats:p>	NA	(None, None)	4	http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/978-1-6684-3710-0.ch035

It links the core ideas of United Nations Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities Article 24, Inclusive Education to describing the development and implementation of a co-constructed, collaborative project to identify success strategies for students with dyslexia, utilizing both student and teacher perspectives and experiences, and examines the fit of utilizing ethnographic approaches in this. As practitioner –researchers, authors provide a narrative case study of a project which was developed/co-constructed to respond to a set of identified needs for a group of students presenting with dyslexia. Authors then examine how the project practices link to research methodology, particularly ethnography, and produce both a set of strategies to work inclusively in the future with students with dyslexia and also construct a methodological approach within the lens of new ethnography. This serves to theories both the project work and guidelines for future use of ethnographic approaches for research in the field of inclusive and special education. </jats:p>	NA	(None, None)	0	http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/978-1-6684-3542-7.ch030

In particular, it explores the minimal engagement of US, Canadian, and Mexican courts with international environmental law. Environmental law cases in Canada, Mexico, and the United States are not immune to international law and international norms. However, international environmental lawyers may be forced to look to some unlikely and unusual places to find international environmental law's normative influence. Environmental law cases in North America seem poised to engage most significantly with international law not in the ‘bright lights’ but rather on the side-lines, where environmental law norms interface with climate law, private international law, Indigenous law, and human rights law.</jats:p>"	en	(None, None)	0	https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/41336/chapter/352410980

Specifically, intervention research in physics education is discussed in terms of the prevalence of randomized designs and meta-analyses of effects from similar interventions. The authors make several recommendations to the physics education research community, citing calls from within and outside of physics education for more rigorous designs, more comprehensive and transparent study reporting practices, and increased efforts to synthesize intervention research. The call for improved reporting practices is framed in the need for supporting replication studies, both direct (i.e., exact) and conceptual, with an acknowledgement of the challenges related to direct replication and the affordances of conceptual replications for theory-building. Included in the chapter are suggestions for how entities such as funding agencies, preeminent journals, and evidence clearinghouses can facilitate knowledge accumulation by incentivizing and supporting more rigorous primary intervention studies, as well as replications and syntheses thereof.</jats:p>	en	(None, None)	0	https://pubs.aip.org/books/book/161/chapter/81724284/Toward-More-Rapid-Accumulation-of-Knowledge-about
