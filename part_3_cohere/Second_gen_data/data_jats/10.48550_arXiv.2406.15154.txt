Title: Analysis of the Publication and Document Types in OpenAlex, Web of Science, Scopus, Pubmed and Semantic Scholar
Abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This study compares and analyses publication and document types in the following bibliographic databases: OpenAlex, Scopus, Web of Science, Semantic Scholar and PubMed. The results demonstrate that typologies can differ considerably between individual database providers. Moreover, the distinction between research and non-research texts, which is required to identify relevant documents for bibliometric analysis, can vary depending on the data source because publications are classified differently in the respective databases. The focus of this study, in addition to the cross-database comparison, is primarily on the coverage and analysis of the publication and document types contained in OpenAlex, as OpenAlex is becoming increasingly important as a free alternative to established proprietary providers for bibliometric analyses at libraries and universities.</jats:p>
