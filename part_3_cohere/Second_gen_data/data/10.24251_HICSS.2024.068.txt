Title: Can (A)I Have a Word with You? A Taxonomy on the Design Dimensions of AI Prompts
Abstract: Emerging generative artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing human collaboration with machines through their remarkable processing of human language. Consequently, the role of AI is transitioning as it becomes adaptable to specific tasks through human language, without the need for additional training data. These "prompts" enable end-users to fully harness the potential of AI. However, the process of designing prompts is currently unstructured, relying mostly on trial-and-error processes. Studies emphasize the significant impact of prompt design on the AI's generated results. Therefore, there is a clear need to establish a structured approach to prompt design. To address this need, we analyzed scientific literature and practical examples to develop a taxonomy of prompt design. The taxonomy serves as a valuable resource for both practitioners and researchers, offering an overview of current AI prompt approaches and shedding light on potential areas for future research.
