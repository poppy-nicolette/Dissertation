Title: Turkish prospective teachers’ understanding and misunderstanding on global warming
Abstract: The key objective of this study is to determine the Turkish elementary prospective teachers' opinions on global warming. It is also aimed to establish prospective teachers' views about the environmental education in Turkish universities. A true–false type scale was administered to 564 prospective teachers from science education, social studies education and primary school education departments of three universities in Turkey. The findings revealed that prospective teachers had some misunderstandings about global warming. It was also found that they accessed information on global warming through informal sources such as TV, radio and Internet. In addition, there were significant differences in participants' total scores in terms of gender and department. According to the findings, prospective teachers thought that environmental education given at universities was not adequate for various reasons.
