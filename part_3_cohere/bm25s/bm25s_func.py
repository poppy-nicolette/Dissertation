documentation: https://github.com/xhluca/bm25s

Inputs: 
    file location is coded into where the indexed files are stored. This should be local. 
    your working folder should have a 'lns_bm25' folder with the indexed corpus. 
    It should include:
    -corpus.jsonl
    -corpus.mmindex.json
    -data.csc.index.npy
    -indices.csc.index.npy
    -indptr.csc.index.npy
    -params.index.json
    -vocab.index.json

Outputs: 
    for a query, returns top-k highest scoring documents. Currently set to 3

Requirements:
bm25s
os
pickle
