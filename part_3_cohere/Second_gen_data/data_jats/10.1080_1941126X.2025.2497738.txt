Title: A Survey of AI tools in Library Tech: Accelerating into and Unlocking Streamlined Enhanced Convenient Empowering Game-Changers
Abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article presents the current status of AI tools in library resources and systems, such as those licensed by Clarivate, Elsevier, and EBSCO. It also offers thoughts on the utility of the tools, how they work, their problems, and their context within the offerings of the companies that own them. Through this article, library workers will gain clarity on the AI tools in the resources and systems they and their patrons use—especially since much of the promotional material from vendors obscures this information. With this information, library workers will be able to make better informed decisions about which, if any, AI tools to subscribe to, activate, or opt out of in their library resources and systems. This article is organized by type of AI tool; it focuses on tools in library software and databases, with brief mention of tools that are for use in classrooms and for teaching, or that are used primarily in healthcare, business, and other sectors.</jats:p>
