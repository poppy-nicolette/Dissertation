Title: Climate Change and Environmental Education: Stance from Science Teachers
Abstract: This study investigated the depth of climate change and environmental education (CCEE) in the current syllabus implemented in Malaysia from the perspectives of teachers, which is an extension to a study entitled ‘Impact of Climate Change on Children: A Malaysian Perspective’. This qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with a pool of teachers selected across Malaysia. Due to the enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO), the respondents were chosen purposively via advertisements posted on social media that targeted science teachers who taught Forms 4 or 5 CCEE-related subjects. The interview sessions were conducted online from June to July 2021. The recorded interviews were transcribed, coded, and categorized into themes deductively based on the UNESCO-Education for Sustainable Development for 2030 toolbox. The findings yielded five themes, namely, building the capacities of educators, empowering, and mobilizing youth, accelerating local-level actions, and advancing policy. Most of the teachers perceived that the Secondary School Standards-based Curriculum (KSSM) had improved but that the focus should be on a student-centered approach rather than exam orientation. There was a lack of awareness of climate change and environmental action in the science textbook. In conclusion, a comprehensive curriculum, as well as empowerment among teachers and students in a conducive environment for CCEE can spawn proactive action by Malaysian students.
