Title: Automating Web Data Collection: Challenges, Solutions, and Python-Based Strategies for Effective Web Scraping
Abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The process of collecting and retrieving such a massive amount of data is difficult, especially when manual approach is the only option. Instead, we can use web scraping to automate the process of collecting web data using bots or automated scripts known as web scrapers. Web scraping as data mining technology is gaining popularity among data scientists and analysts, it is also causing controversy due to ethical concerns about the ability of get data due to privacy and copyright using automated programs or tools. This paper aims to classify and estimate the various challenges and solutions associated with web scraping algorithms, specifically those utilizing python libraries, and addressing the ethical implication associated with this technology.</jats:p>
