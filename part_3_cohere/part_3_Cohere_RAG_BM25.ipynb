      "DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2404.17663, Title:  An analysis of the suitability of OpenAlex for bibliometric analyses Abstract: Scopus and the Web of Science have been the foundation for research in the science of science even though these traditional databases systematically underrepresent certain disciplines and world regions. In response, new inclusive databases, notably OpenAlex, have emerged. While many studies have begun using OpenAlex as a data source, few critically assess its limitations. This study, conducted in collaboration with the OpenAlex team, addresses this gap by comparing OpenAlex to Scopus across a number of dimensions. The analysis concludes that OpenAlex is a superset of Scopus and can be a reliable alternative for some analyses, particularly at the country level. Despite this, issues of metadata accuracy and completeness show that additional research is needed to fully comprehend and address OpenAlex's limitations. Doing so will be necessary to confidently use OpenAlex across a wider set of analyses, including those that are not at all possible with more constrained databases.\n",
      "DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2406.15154, Title:  Analysis of the Publication and Document Types in OpenAlex, Web of Science, Scopus, Pubmed and Semantic Scholar Abstract: This study compares and analyses publication and document types in the following bibliographic databases: OpenAlex, Scopus, Web of Science, Semantic Scholar and PubMed. The results demonstrate that typologies can differ considerably between individual database providers. Moreover, the distinction between research and non-research texts, which is required to identify relevant documents for bibliometric analysis, can vary depending on the data source because publications are classified differently in the respective databases. The focus of this study, in addition to the cross-database comparison, is primarily on the coverage and analysis of the publication and document types contained in OpenAlex, as OpenAlex is becoming increasingly important as a free alternative to established proprietary providers for bibliometric analyses at libraries and universities.\n",
      "DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2402.01788, Title:  LitLLM: A Toolkit for Scientific Literature Review Abstract: Conducting literature reviews for scientific papers is essential for understanding research, its limitations, and building on existing work. It is a tedious task which makes an automatic literature review generator appealing. Unfortunately, many existing works that generate such reviews using Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant limitations. They tend to hallucinate-generate non-actual information-and ignore the latest research they have not been trained on. To address these limitations, we propose a toolkit that operates on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) principles, specialized prompting and instructing techniques with the help of LLMs. Our system first initiates a web search to retrieve relevant papers by summarizing user-provided abstracts into keywords using an off-the-shelf LLM. Authors can enhance the search by supplementing it with relevant papers or keywords, contributing to a tailored retrieval process. Second, the system re-ranks the retrieved papers based on the user-provided abstract. Finally, the related work section is generated based on the re-ranked results and the abstract. There is a substantial reduction in time and effort for literature review compared to traditional methods, establishing our toolkit as an efficient alternative. Our open-source toolkit is accessible at https://github.com/shubhamagarwal92/LitLLM and Huggingface space (https://huggingface.co/spaces/shubhamagarwal92/LitLLM) with the video demo at https://youtu.be/E2ggOZBAFw0.\n",
      "DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2410.04231, Title:  Metadata-based Data Exploration with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models Abstract: Developing the capacity to effectively search for requisite datasets is an urgent requirement to assist data users in identifying relevant datasets considering the very limited available metadata. For this challenge, the utilization of third-party data is emerging as a valuable source for improvement. Our research introduces a new architecture for data exploration which employs a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance metadata-based data discovery. The system integrates large language models (LLMs) with external vector databases to identify semantic relationships among diverse types of datasets. The proposed framework offers a new method for evaluating semantic similarity among heterogeneous data sources and for improving data exploration. Our study includes experimental results on four critical tasks: 1) recommending similar datasets, 2) suggesting combinable datasets, 3) estimating tags, and 4) predicting variables. Our results demonstrate that RAG can enhance the selection of relevant datasets, particularly from different categories, when compared to conventional metadata approaches. However, performance varied across tasks and models, which confirms the significance of selecting appropriate techniques based on specific use cases. The findings suggest that this approach holds promise for addressing challenges in data exploration and discovery, although further refinement is necessary for estimation tasks.\n",
      "DOI: 10.1590/SciELOPreprints.11205, Title:  On the Open Road to Universal Indexing: OpenAlex and OpenJournal Systems Abstract: This study examines OpenAlex’s indexing of journals using Open Journal Systems (JUOJS), reflecting two open source software initiatives supporting inclusive scholarly participation. By analyzing a dataset of 47,625 active JUOJS, we reveal that 71% of these journals have at least one article indexed in OpenAlex. Our findings underscore the central role of Crossref DOIs in achieving indexing, with 97% of the journals using Crossref DOIs included in OpenAlex. However, this technical dependency reflects broader structural inequities, as resource-limited journals, particularly those from low-income countries (47% of JUOJS) and non-English language journals (55%-64% of JUOJS), remain underrepresented. Our work highlights the theoretical implications of scholarly infrastructure dependencies and their role in perpetuating systemic disparities in global knowledge visibility. We argue that even inclusive bibliographic databases like OpenAlex must actively address financial, infrastructural, and linguistic barriers to foster equitable indexing on a global scale. By conceptualizing the relationship between indexing mechanisms, persistent identifiers, and structural inequities, this study provides a critical lens for rethinking the dynamics of universal indexing and its realization in a global, multilingual scholarly ecosystem.\n",
