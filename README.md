### venv
This uses a venv for running the Part3 notebook. 
source part_3_cohere/bin/activate
**You can find this on the local PHD drive, not here in Github as its silly to bring in a venv to a repository**

## Todo:
- [ ] set up requirements.txt file for each notebook
- [x] rewrite Part 1 notebook to compare Crossref REST and XML APIs - make it more simple.
- [x] Reduce Part 1 notebook down to functions for use in later notebooks
- [ ] Part 1 analysis complete
- [ ] Part 1 results in Chapter 4.
- [ ] Part 2 data collection
