Title: M-RAG: Enhancing Open-domain Question Answering with Metadata Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Metadata Retrieval-Augmented Generation (M-RAG) method that can effectively search and answer questions with an open-domain Question Answering (ODQA) system for one or more documents and compare their performance. To do this, it utilizes embeddings with metadata and generative models such as GPT-3.5-turbo-16K and GPT-4 to generate automated responses. Through the method of this paper, the generative model (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) can understand the order and context of the document through metadata and answer it. In addition, through prompt engineering that adds the source of the document and the original text requirements, the source indication function of the question and answer (QA) can be activated, which can increase the accuracy of the answer. As a result of the experiment, the method in this paper showed a performance improvement of up to 46% compared to the same external inference ODQA system, and also showed a 6% performance improvement over the conventional RAG method.
