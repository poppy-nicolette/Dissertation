Title: Ask and You Shall Receive: Taxonomy of AI Prompts for Medical Education
Abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This manuscript meticulously explores the approach for interacting with Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Models (LLMs) to elicit optimal outputs. The generation of high-caliber prompts serves as a pivotal element in achieving the sought-after outcomes from these computational models. The discourse herein delineates various categories of prompts, substantiated with exemplars within each domain of application under investigation. This manuscript highlights the categories of prompts related to the particular utility of each application domain, especially accentuating their relevance to educational stakeholders such as students and educators in medical education. The Application of Learning Domains (ALDs) proposed within this article, endeavor to demarcate areas that may find the most utility from AI LLMs, facilitating knowledge dissemination, practice and training, simulated personas, and augmented interactivity across a spectrum of users in the educational milieu and beyond.</jats:p>
