    "SciBERT is used for embeddings in a dense vector array for the query. \n",
    "This version is different in that it uses BM25 as a pre-retriever for the input text to reduce how many documents are processed by SciBERT (embeddings) and the generator.\n",

    "    - BM25 is used to retrieve top-k candidate documents based on keyword matching\n",
    "2. Dense embedding retrieval\n",
    "    - query is embedded using SciBERT and the retrieved documents.\n",
    "3. Re-ranking\n",
