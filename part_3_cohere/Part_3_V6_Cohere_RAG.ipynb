Using a quantitative approach, we selected a random Crossref sample of more than 115,000 records, which was then searched in seven databases (Dimensions, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, OpenAlex, Scilit, Semantic Scholar, and The Lens). Seven characteristics were analyzed (abstract, access, bibliographic info, document type, publication date, language, and identifiers), to observe fields that describe this information, the completeness rate of these fields, and the agreement among databases. The results show that academic search engines (Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and Semantic Scholar) gather less information and have a low degree of completeness. Conversely, third-party databases (Dimensions, OpenAlex, Scilit, and The Lens) have more metadata quality and a higher completeness rate. We conclude that academic search engines lack the ability to retrieve reliable descriptive data by crawling the web, and the main problem of third-party databases is the loss of information derived from integrating different sources.\\n', 'DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2303.17661\\n Title: MetaEnhance: Metadata Quality Improvement for Electronic Theses and Dissertations of University Libraries\\nAbstract: Metadata quality is crucial for digital objects to be discovered through digital library interfaces. However, due to various reasons, the metadata of digital objects often exhibits incomplete, inconsistent, and incorrect values. We investigate methods to automatically detect, correct, and canonicalize scholarly metadata, using seven key fields of electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) as a case study. We propose MetaEnhance, a framework that utilizes state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods to improve the quality of these fields. To evaluate MetaEnhance, we compiled a metadata quality evaluation benchmark containing 500 ETDs, by combining subsets sampled using multiple criteria. We tested MetaEnhance on this benchmark and found that the proposed methods achieved nearly perfect F1-scores in detecting errors and F1-scores in correcting errors ranging from 0.85 to 1.00 for five of seven fields.\\n', 'DOI: 10.31222/osf.io/smxe5\\n Title: Crossref as a source of open bibliographic metadata\\nAbstract: Several initiatives have been taken to promote the open availability of bibliographic metadata of scholarly publications in Crossref.

Our analysis shows that the availability of these metadata elements has improved over time, at least for journal articles, the most common publication type in Crossref.

Funder metadata tends to get into scholarly databases in two ways. It can be provided by publishers when  registering a work for a DOI, or it can be inferred from analyzing an article’s Acknowledgements section.  Unfortunately, the funder metadata field is an optional value at DOI registration, so it is often left blank.  OpenAlex uses Crossref as a major building block in its dataset, with the general consequence that if Crossref  doesn’t have it, OpenAlex won’t see it.

The COVID‐19 pandemic has prompted intensive research and has changed traditional publishing with the massive adoption of preprints by researchers. Our aim is to investigate whether the crisis and the ensuing scientific and economic competition have changed the lexical content of abstracts. We propose a comparative study of abstracts associated with preprints issued in response to the pandemic relative to abstracts produced during the closest pre‐pandemic period. We show that with the increase (on average and in percentage) of positive words (especially effective ) and the slight decrease of negative words, there is a strong increase in hedge words (the most frequent of which are the modal verbs can and may ). Hedge words counterbalance the excessive use of positive words and thus invite the readers, who go probably beyond the ‘usual’ audience, to be cautious with the obtained results. The abstracts of preprints urgently produced in response to the COVID‐19 crisis stand between uncertainty and over‐promotion, illustrating the balance that authors have to achieve between promoting their results and appealing for caution.\\n\"]\n",

Using a quantitative approach, we selected a random Crossref sample of more than 115,000 records, which was then searched in seven databases (Dimensions, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, OpenAlex, Scilit, Semantic Scholar, and The Lens). Seven characteristics were analyzed (abstract, access, bibliographic info, document type, publication date, language, and identifiers), to observe fields that describe this information, the completeness rate of these fields, and the agreement among databases. The results show that academic search engines (Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and Semantic Scholar) gather less information and have a low degree of completeness. Conversely, third-party databases (Dimensions, OpenAlex, Scilit, and The Lens) have more metadata quality and a higher completeness rate. We conclude that academic search engines lack the ability to retrieve reliable descriptive data by crawling the web, and the main problem of third-party databases is the loss of information derived from integrating different sources.\\n', 'DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2303.17661\\n Title: MetaEnhance: Metadata Quality Improvement for Electronic Theses and Dissertations of University Libraries\\nAbstract: Metadata quality is crucial for digital objects to be discovered through digital library interfaces. However, due to various reasons, the metadata of digital objects often exhibits incomplete, inconsistent, and incorrect values. We investigate methods to automatically detect, correct, and canonicalize scholarly metadata, using seven key fields of electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) as a case study. We propose MetaEnhance, a framework that utilizes state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods to improve the quality of these fields. To evaluate MetaEnhance, we compiled a metadata quality evaluation benchmark containing 500 ETDs, by combining subsets sampled using multiple criteria. We tested MetaEnhance on this benchmark and found that the proposed methods achieved nearly perfect F1-scores in detecting errors and F1-scores in correcting errors ranging from 0.85 to 1.00 for five of seven fields.\\n', 'DOI: 10.31222/osf.io/smxe5\\n Title: Crossref as a source of open bibliographic metadata\\nAbstract: Several initiatives have been taken to promote the open availability of bibliographic metadata of scholarly publications in Crossref. We present an up-to-date overview of the availability of six metadata elements in Crossref: reference lists, abstracts, ORCIDs, author affiliations, funding information, and license information. Our analysis shows that the availability of these metadata elements has improved over time, at least for journal articles, the most common publication type in Crossref. However, the analysis also shows that many publishers need to make additional efforts to realize full openness of bibliographic metadata.\\n', 'DOI: 10.31274/b8136f97.ccc3dae4\\n Title: Comparing Funder Metadata in OpenAlex and Dimensions\\nAbstract: I often need to look at metadata for scholarly articles that acknowledge a particular funding agency or group of  agencies. I wanted to compare the results from OpenAlex, a free and open scholarly database that provides  metadata under a CC0 license, and Dimensions, a paid database we have a site license to here at Iowa State  University (note: Dimensions also offers a free version, but with limited features that do not include a Funder  filter).  Funder metadata tends to get into scholarly databases in two ways. It can be provided by publishers when  registering a work for a DOI, or it can be inferred from analyzing an article’s Acknowledgements section.  Unfortunately, the funder metadata field is an optional value at DOI registration, so it is often left blank.  OpenAlex uses Crossref as a major building block in its dataset, with the general consequence that if Crossref  doesn’t have it, OpenAlex won’t see it. By contrast, Dimensions analyzes an article’s Acknowledgements  section using natural language processing to infer funders and enrich the metadata coming from Crossref. It  also has agreements with publishers to obtain additional funding information.\\n', \"DOI: 10.1002/leap.1411\\n Title: Over‐promotion and caution in abstracts of preprints during the <scp>COVID</scp>‐19 crisis\\nAbstract: Abstract The abstract is known to be a promotional genre where researchers tend to exaggerate the benefit of their research and use a promotional discourse to catch the reader's attention. The COVID‐19 pandemic has prompted intensive research and has changed traditional publishing with the massive adoption of preprints by researchers. Our aim is to investigate whether the crisis and the ensuing scientific and economic competition have changed the lexical content of abstracts. We propose a comparative study of abstracts associated with preprints issued in response to the pandemic relative to abstracts produced during the closest pre‐pandemic period. We show that with the increase (on average and in percentage) of positive words (especially effective ) and the slight decrease of negative words, there is a strong increase in hedge words (the most frequent of which are the modal verbs can and may ). Hedge words counterbalance the excessive use of positive words and thus invite the readers, who go probably beyond the ‘usual’ audience, to be cautious with the obtained results. The abstracts of preprints urgently produced in response to the COVID‐19 crisis stand between uncertainty and over‐promotion, illustrating the balance that authors have to achieve between promoting their results and appealing for caution.\\n\"]\n",
