## Presentation overview

-   Introduction
-   Part 1: Random sample
-   Part 2: Comparing sources
-   Part 3: RAG in action
-   Concluding thoughts and questions

# Introduction

## Background {.scrollable}

abstracts as summaries, though limited in depth

many abstracts, might provide a more holistic answer

systematic review well known process

abstracts may be available when the paper is [paywalled]{.yellow}

summer of 2024 experimented using abstracts as a source of RAG applications

cite work by Zain and Gowri, published proceedings,

3 areas should be explored:

1.  metadata characterization
2.  metadata source
3.  evaluate characteristic impact through case study

### Gaps addressed

-   evidence for bibliometric metadata directly as a document source in RAG

-   Lack of characterization of title and abstract metadata

-   Metadata source: compares two sources for effects of aggregation and transformation

## Framework

::: notes
past studies have examined coverage, completeness, accuracy, but not content.

# Part 1: Characterize metadata {.scrollable}

## Characterize metadata from Crossref {.scrollable}

What are the characteristics of textual metadata from a registration agency, such as Crossref?

![](images/part_1.svg){fig-align="center"}

Example:

Abstract metadata from <https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1103/physrevd.110.036015>

![](images/abstract.png){fig-align="center"}

Or, another example from <https://api.crossref.org/works/10.33024/hjk.v15i1.3791>:

![](images/abstract2.png){fig-align="center"}

Or one that contains geometric shapes, from <https://api.crossref.org/works/10.1108/eemcs-04-2022-0108>

# Part 2: Compare data sources

## Compare the same metadata from Crossref and OpenAlex

## Title

## Slide with linear-gradient

| Value | Description                           |
|-------|---------------------------------------|
| `c/t` | Slide number / total slides (default) |
| `c`   | Slide number only                     |
| `h/v` | Horizontal / Vertical slide number    |
| `h.v` | Horizontal . Vertical slide number    |
