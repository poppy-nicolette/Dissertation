Abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Objectives</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Precise literature recommendation and summarization are crucial for biomedical professionals. While the latest iteration of generative pretrained transformer (GPT) incorporates 2 distinct modes—real-time search and pretrained model utilization—it encounters challenges in dealing with these tasks. Specifically, the real-time search can pinpoint some relevant articles but occasionally provides fabricated papers, whereas the pretrained model excels in generating well-structured summaries but struggles to cite specific sources. In response, this study introduces RefAI, an innovative retrieval-augmented generative tool designed to synergize the strengths of large language models (LLMs) while overcoming their limitations.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Materials and Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>RefAI utilized PubMed for systematic literature retrieval, employed a novel multivariable algorithm for article recommendation, and leveraged GPT-4 turbo for summarization. Ten queries under 2 prevalent topics (“cancer immunotherapy and target therapy” and “LLMs in medicine”) were chosen as use cases and 3 established counterparts (ChatGPT-4, ScholarAI, and Gemini) as our baselines. The evaluation was conducted by 10 domain experts through standard statistical analyses for performance comparison.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The overall performance of RefAI surpassed that of the baselines across 5 evaluated dimensions—relevance and quality for literature recommendation, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and reference integration for summarization, with the majority exhibiting statistically significant improvements (P-values &amp;lt;.05).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Discussion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>RefAI demonstrated substantial improvements in literature recommendation and summarization over existing tools, addressing issues like fabricated papers, metadata inaccuracies, restricted recommendations, and poor reference integration.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>By augmenting LLM with external resources and a novel ranking algorithm, RefAI is uniquely capable of recommending high-quality literature and generating well-structured summaries, holding the potential to meet the critical needs of biomedical professionals in navigating and synthesizing vast amounts of scientific literature.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>
