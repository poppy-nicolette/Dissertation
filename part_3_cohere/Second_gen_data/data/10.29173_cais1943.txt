Title: Investigating Document Type Discrepancies between OpenAlex and the Web of Science
Abstract: Bibliometrics, whether used for research or research evaluation, relies on large multidisciplinary databases of research outputs and citation indices. The Web of Science (WoS) was the main supporting infrastructure of the field for more than 30 years until several new competitors emerged. OpenAlex, launched in 2022, stands out for its openness and extensive coverage. While OpenAlex may reduce or eliminate barriers to accessing bibliometric data, one of the concerns that hinder its broader adoption for research and research evaluation is the quality of its metadata. This study aims to assess the metadata quality of works in OpenAlex and WoS, focusing on document type accuracy. We observe that over 4% of the publications indexed in both OpenAlex and WoS appear to be misclassified as research articles or reviews, and that the vast majority (about 97%) of these errors occur in OpenAlex. By addressing discrepancies and misattributions in document types this research seeks to enhance awareness of data quality issues that could impact bibliometric research and evaluation outcomes.
