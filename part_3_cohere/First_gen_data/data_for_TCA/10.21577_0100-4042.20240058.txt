Title: SUSTENTABILIDADE E ODS NAS PÁGINAS: UMA ANÁLISE DE CONTEÚDO DOS LIVROS DIDÁTICOS DO PNLD 2021 NO CONTEXTO DA QUÍMICA
Abstract: SUSTAINABILITY AND SDGS ON THE PAGES: A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF PNLD 2021 TEXTBOOKS IN THE CONTEXT OF CHEMISTRY. Sustainability and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have gained prominence in contemporary discourse, driven by the urgency of addressing climate change and demand for transformative actions for planet preservation. Recognized by global entities such as the United Nations and the Brazilian Chemical Society, Basic Education is crucial for instigating societal change. In the context of the diverse Brazilian classrooms, textbooks stand out as a common resource for educators and students, so how would the terms sustainability and SDGs be used in textbooks? Are these terms covered in the context of chemistry? This article utilizes Bardin’s content analysis to approach the terms sustainability and SDGs in National Textbook Program (PNLD) materials for Natural Sciences area, focusing on chemistry. The analysis of PNLD collections revealed that “sustainability” is broadly defined, but lacks specific contextualization within chemistry. SDGs, on the other hand, are mentioned cursorily, serving more as historical markers than engaging in meaningful discourse. Consequently, this article emphasizes the need for greater involvement of the chemistry community in shaping decisions related to textbooks. It calls for a concerted effort by chemistry Educators and Society to actively contribute to educational material discussions, fostering a more comprehensive integration of sustainability and SDGs within Chemistry Education.
