0	10.1521/soco.2021.39.5.543	article	journal-article	False	The Limits of Defaults: The Influence of Decision Time on Default Effects	The stability of default effects to contextual features is critical to their use in policy. In this paper, decision time was investigated as a contextual factor that may pose limits on the efficacy of defaults. Consistent with the hypothesis that time constraints may increase reliance on contextual cues, four experiments, including a preregistered one of a nationally representative sample, and a meta-analysis that included four additional pilot experiments, indicated that short decision times increased the advantage of action defaults (i.e., the default option automatically endorsed the desired behavior) and that the default advantage was trivial or nonexistent when decision times were longer. These effects replicated for naturalistic as well as externally induced decision times and were present even when participants were unaware that time was limited. This research has critical implications for psychological science and allied disciplines concerned with policy in the domains of public health, finance and economics, marketing, and environmental sciences.	en	4	NA	NA	NA	https://openalex.org/W4206395497

This retrospective study aims to compare the differences in demographic, clinical, and biochemical variables and predictive factors in 2 situations of ARDS cause (COVID-19 vs NON-COVID-19) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was performed for quantitative variables, and Fisher exact test for qualitative variables. 115 patients with ARDS were enrolled (53 patients with COVID-19 ARDS and 62 NON-COVID-19 ARDS). The COVID-19 ARDS group consisted of 33 male patients (66.2%), whereas the NON-COVID-19 ARDS group had 25 male patients (40.3%) (P = .0248). The median and interquartile age difference of the COVID-19 ARDS group was 64.0 [52.0-69.5], and non-COVID-19 ARDS was 49.0 [34.0-63.0] (P = .0011). Body mass index, simplified acute physiology score, sequential organ failure assessment, and intensive care unit length of stay, with P-values of .0061, .0002, .0003, and <.0001, respectively (COVID-19 vs NON-COVID-19 ARDS). Diabetes, arterial hypertension, venous thrombosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had values of <.0001, .0234, .0358, and .0001, respectively. On the other hand, the NON-COVID-19 ARDS group had a greater need for dialysis (P = .0109). The stepwise logistic regression showed that relevant clinical, and demographic characteristics associated with ARDS due to COVID-19, such as male gender, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and body mass index, were independent prognostic factors of severity in patients with COVID-19 ARDS, compared to NON-COVID-19 ARDS. The overall mortality rate was 62.9% for COVID-19 ARDS and 77.4% for the non-COVID-19 ARDS group (P = .2950). Ventilatory parameters of COVID-19 ARDS and NON-COVID-19 ARDS were similar.	en	0	NA	publishedVersion	cc-by-nc	https://openalex.org/W4408845899

As specified in the project description, structural steel has been quite popular for the past 30 years, it’s been fruitful to experience the efficiency of the structural steel properties during the design process and achievement. To accomplish this design, we mainly used licensed software by Autodesk, including Revit Structures for the architectural design and Robot Structural Analysis Professional for the structural analysis and design. The analysis shown that Steel's ductility allows it to withstand significant deformation before breaking. Steel-framed buildings' ductility allows them to disperse energy from earthquake-induced building movement, reducing structural damage. Hence, it would be a sustainable construction process when adequate structural steel in the building especially for the multi-storied building cases.	en	0	NA	NA	NA	https://openalex.org/W4405753934

For the proponents of healthy longevity and advocates of aging research. Mechnikov may be well credited as “the father” of gerontology — the disciplinary term he coined. Mechnikov was either a direct originator or one of the primary researchers for a variety of key aging-ameliorating and life-extending methods, experiments and research programs that are still being followed today. In view of the immense significance of degenerative aging processes for the emergence of virtually all diseases, both communicable and noncommunicable, and in view of the accelerating development of potential means to intervene into and ameliorate these processes for the sake of achieving healthy longevity, Mechnikov’s pioneering contribution to this field assumes an ever greater global significance and must be remembered and honored.	en	0	http://www.internalmed-journal.in.ua/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Журнал_3_2020_С_29-30.pdf	publishedVersion	NA	https://openalex.org/W3112664047

However, the interaction between the depth and elevation of the shading devices and their impact on indoor daylight performance is not fully understood, especially for the case of tropical buildings with bilateral openings. This study therefore aims to evaluate the design possibilities of external shading devices with various depth and elevation in terms of daylight performance for the case of tropical school classrooms with bilateral openings in an Indonesian city. A computational simulation method using Radiance is utilized to perform annual daylight metrics calculations. Geometry, material, and simulation settings are prepared using the Ladybug tool under Grasshopper for four building orientations, namely 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are conducted for all design combinations. The results show that the interaction between a shading device’s depth and elevation is unique, depending on the building orientation and the availability of direct sunlight. In general, shading elevation is more influential, compared to shading depth, on the observed daylight metrics and the combined objective functions at all orientations.	en	13	https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/12/6/818/pdf?version=1655117001	publishedVersion	cc-by	https://openalex.org/W4282836451

The subject of this research is the legal custom as one nontraditional sources of law for the Russian criminal proceeding, which is applied in the absence of norms consolidated in the normative legal acts, which are aimed at regulating the corresponding legal relations. Analysis is conducted on the essence of the concept of legal custom, means of formation, classification, and methods of application in criminal proceedings. Special attention is given to the methods of authorization of legal custom by the state, which may entail the recognition of this source of law as independent or transformation into another source of law. The main conclusions that also determine the scientific novelty of this research are as follows. 1. The system of Russia criminal procedure law is characterized by the development processes, which imply the formation and application of such an nontraditional source of law as legal custom. 2. Legal custom represents the rules not prohibited by law for performing procedural actions and making procedural decisions, which are translated into practice through repetition by the of the proceedings in the absence of the enforceable rule of law. 3. According to the method of formation, legal customs in criminal proceedings can be classified into dispositive (based on the voluntary will of the participants) and imperative (formed through tacit administrative influence). 4. Imperative legal customs are the negative phenomena of legal reality and cannot be attributed to the sources of law. 5. Authorization of legal custom as an independent source of law consists in its &amp;ldquo;tacit&amp;rdquo; approval by the government authorities. Textual consolidation of legal custom entails its transformation into a new form of law. 6. Universal practice is one of the characteristics of legal custom and a possible means for its legalization.	en	0	http://nbpublish.com/library_get_pdf.php?id=35160	publishedVersion	NA	https://openalex.org/W3168626356

Our understanding for how teachers develop creative self‐regulation skills and knowledge for the classroom remains limited. This longitudinal case study begins to fill this gap with an in‐depth investigation of one U.S. high school teachers' development and application of CSR in relationship to her creative agency in teaching. This study incorporated a variety of data sources to document and understand CSR development for the distinct challenges of creative teaching and facilitation of creative learning. Results indicated the teacher began with a more rigid and dysregulated CSR approach, which developed across 2 years of professional development into a flexible and experimental approach. The teacher demonstrated a strong creative agency and trust in her intuition by the end of the 2 years. Findings suggested the key CSR skills that catalyzed her approach included withholding judgment and releasing control to students. Future research on teachers' creative development and CSR for the classroom can investigate these characteristics further. Results also reinforced the important connection between CSR development and the beliefs, values, and attitudes that formed the teachers' creative agency—another area for future research.	en	0	NA	publishedVersion	cc-by-nc-nd	https://openalex.org/W4408977866

Using ISSR, SSR	In the current investigation, the genetic relations, and the genetic dimension of seven olive varieties (Olea europaea L.) were identified using, ISSR, and SSR markers. The study involved uses leaves from different samples for DNA extraction. The DNA amount ranged from 150 to 400 micrograms with purity ranging between 1.6 to 1.9. Agarose gel electrophoresis is applied to evaluate PCR reaction success. The ISSR marker, which used 4 primers, showed different results for the multiplication. Various bands were observed that differed from each other, resulting in a total of 93 bands - 2 general and 91 different. The primer also distinguished unique bands, with 4 unique bands and 7 absent bands. The primer with the highest molecular size (1500bp) was UBC-817, while the lowest molecular volume (200bp) was observed in the UBC-826 primer. The marker results indicated that the two types, Suranie (3) and Frantoio (4), had the lowest hereditary dimension of (0.030). The Frantoio and Santacatrina varieties showed the highest genetic difference, with a value of 0.622. According to the genetic relationship analysis, there were three main groups. The first group consisted of a single category (5), while There were two subgroups in the second group, B1 and B2. Subgroup B1 had only one category, while the rest of the categories were in Subgroup B2.. Even though these markers use different mechanisms to detect variance and genome coverage, they complement each other. Moreover, five SSR markers were used in this study to describe seven olive cultivars and analyze their genetic relationship. Four out of five primers showed positive results, while one was not present. The SSR markers were effective in identifying the similarity of collected species, as they are specialized indicators ISSR markers.	en	0	https://journal.hmjournals.com/index.php/JPDMHD/article/download/4931/3467	publishedVersion	cc-by	https://openalex.org/W4403156040
