Despite its pivotal role in the software development life-cycle (SDLC) for ensuring software quality in terms of both functional and non-functional aspects, testing within this intricate software–hardware ecosystem has been somewhat overlooked. To address this, various testing techniques are applied for real-time minimization of failure rates in IoT applications. However, the execution of a comprehensive test suite for specific IoT software remains a complex undertaking. This paper proposes a holistic framework aimed at aiding quality assurance engineers in delineating essential testing methods across different testing levels within the IoT. This delineation is crucial for effective quality assurance, ultimately reducing failure rates in real-time scenarios. Furthermore, the paper offers a mapping of these identified tests to each layer within the layered framework of the IoT. This comprehensive approach seeks to enhance the reliability and performance of IoT-based applications.'}	1	https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/22/15683	2	dict	https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/	https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

It promotes a suitable and better utilization of non-renewable resources in the environment. The benefits of using micro-organisms are associated with direct and indirect mechanisms, mainly related to improvements in the absorption and availability of nutrients, resulting in a consequent impact on plant growth. The main benefits of using biochemical pesticides are the promotion of sustainability and the management of resistance to pests and diseases. Although the use of micro-organisms and botanical metabolites is a promising agricultural alternative, they are still primarily concentrated in grain crops. There is a huge opportunity to expand the plant-based and micro-organism-based biological inputs used in agriculture due to the wide range of mechanisms of action of those products. At a global level, several terminologies have been adopted to characterize biological inputs, but many terms used conflict with Brazilian legislation. This review will clarify the classes of biological inputs existing in Brazil as well as present the application and evolution of the market for microbiological and plant-based inputs.'}	0	https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/12/22/3844	2	dict	https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/	https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

Hence, this study aimed to clarify ACE inhibitors pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics differences, assess the cost-effectiveness of ACE inhibitors, elaborate safety and side effects of ACE inhibitors, discuss which ACE inhibitor is favorable for variety of cases, and to promote more comparison studies and head-to-head trials between ACE inhibitors. This review article used published studies of ACE inhibitors properties and extracted data from Saudi Food and Drug Administration. It was found that enalapril has the longest duration of action of all ACE inhibitors, lasting 35 to 38 hours. While perindopril has the highest bioavailability, 65-75%, compared to other ACE inhibitors. The price variance of ACE inhibitors was found as lisinopril with the lowest price (18.7–37.45 Saudi Riyals SAR) and zofenopril with the highest price ($192). Further, zofenopril, trandolapril, and quinapril are the medications that are unavailable in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, angioedema is one of the most dangerous side effects of ACE inhibitors, along with hyperkalemia, kidney issues, headaches, and cough. However, the side effects of all these drugs are similar. Hence, it was concluded that the future of ACE inhibitors might also involve improved safety profiles through the development of novel ACE inhibitors with fewer side effects or better tolerability.'}	0	https://www.ejmanager.com/fulltextpdf.php?mno=171751	2	dict	no license	no license

In Africa, the COVID-19 infection may be influenced by malaria coinfection. Global health is severely hampered by the co-infection of COVID-19 and malaria, especially in areas where both illnesses are endemic. Studies that have already been conducted indicate that those who have co-infection may have more severe symptoms and a higher risk of dying, even though there is little information on the prevalence and consequences of co-infection. More studies and focused initiatives are required to address this issue because of the difficulties in diagnosing the two diseases and the possibility that co-infection would worsen already existing health inequities. Methodology: This review follows the guidelines of PRISMA. In this article, we reviewed published articles from 2019 to May 2023 on COVID-19 and malaria co-infection that might influence the ontology of COVID-19. Results: Sub-Saharan African countries have fewer COVID-19 cases due to factors like young populations, warm weather, lack of proper diagnosis, malaria history, and antimalarial drug use. Population genetics also influence COVID-19 dynamics. Clinical and pathological similarities between malaria and COVID-19 have confused diagnosis and treatment in Africa. Conclusion: Understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 infection in Sub-Saharan Africa and how another endemic disease like malaria shapes it can provide insights into how to tailor successful diagnostic, intervention, and control plans that lower disease morbidity and mortality. Coinfection with COVID-19 and malaria is related to expanded all-cause in-hospital mortality compared to mono-infection with serious acute respiratory disorder coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).'}	0	https://wjarr.com/content/how-covid-19-and-malaria-are-strikingly-alike-short-review	2	dict	no license	no license

In the parameter regimes in which bounce resonance overlaps with Landau resonance, the higher harmonic bounce resonance may accelerate electrons at the velocity much lower than the wave phase velocity to Landau resonance region, enhancing Landau damping of the wave. Meanwhile, Landau resonance can increase the number of electrons in the lower harmonic bounce resonance region. Thus electrons can be efficiently heated. The result might be applicable for collisionless electron heating in low-temperature plasma discharges.'}}	0	no resolution url	2	dict	https://iopscience.iop.org/page/copyright	https://iopscience.iop.org/page/copyright

Bodies and bodily matter figure as central actors in this practice of resistance. In this article, I draw from fieldwork I conducted with Palestinian women and medical staff in the occupied West Bank to examine the tension between carcerality and matter(ing). I argue that bodies and bodily matter are constitutive of the relationship between oppression and resistance. I analyze how Israeli military authorities assign evidentiary status to Palestinian bodies and illustrate how Palestinian families challenge the Israeli carceral system through new modes of embodied resistance. This article demonstrates how intersecting forms of oppression shape and are being shaped by bodies and their materiality. It also suggests that theorizing the materiality of power from Palestine offers new ways of understanding the political work that bodies do.'}	1	http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1357034X231201950	2	dict	no license	no license

The first part reveals the content of the concept of «transfer of students’ human capital», while justifying its application in the study of the educational failure/success of schoolchildren and students. The second part presents a theoretical model of the considered phenomenon through such structural elements as goals, subjects, processes and mechanisms. The third part is devoted to the contradictions in the transfer of human capital within educational communities in Russia. The contradictions between goals and interests of the subjects of education are regarded as the key ones. The final part expands on how significant the concept under consideration is to sociology of education. The results of an interdisciplinary study conducted in 2019–2021 in Sverdlovsk region’s educational facilities (schools, colleges, universities) serve as the empirical foundation for the article. It is shown that transfer of students’ human capital is a kind of capital movement, with its features determined by the social nature of educational activities and interaction. The process under study is associated with such a phenomenon as academic success/failure of students, given that while it unfolds the human capital of schoolchildren and students can either be developed or depleted. The transfer of human capital involves three groups of education subjects — actors, agents and participants who perform certain social roles and possess varying opportunities for regulating this process. The empirical data is interpreted based on the proposed theoretical model, with the results indicating the contradictions of the goals, vectors and results of the transfer of human capital among Russian students.'}	1	https://www.journal-socjournal.ru/index.php/socjour/article/view/8426	2	dict	no license	no license

Recent evidence suggests that a game-based approaches have a potential in health and wellbeing sector. This research is conducted based on two main aspects: development of game application on food and nutrition for pre-school children and evaluation involving users on the usability of the developed game. This game application has been developed based on the ADDIE model which consist of five phases, Analysis, Design, Develop, Implementation and Evaluation. The usability evaluation on the game application involved children in early ages. The genre of the games is based on platform and it is a singleplayer game that contains three modules: food pyramid, healthy maze, and my plate. For the usability, the game application received positive feedbacks from the users where they gain some knowledge and enjoy playing the game. This finding provides a valuable knowledge to the design and development of the game application in food and nutritions sector.'}	0	https://myjms.mohe.gov.my/index.php/mij/article/view/14172	2	dict	no license	no license
14	14	14	10.3390/h14020028	journal_article	“Curiosa Impertinente”: Women and Curiosity on the Spanish–North African Borderlands	{'language': None, 'text': 'In European imaginings of the Islamic world, women incited intense curiosity and were often depicted by early modern writers as sexualized subjects and curious objects of male desire. However, this Orientalist fascination ignores the very curiosity of these women and their desire to glean knowledge about the world around them. While curiosity became increasingly valued in the early modern period as a means of progress, female curiosity was still often linked to the perils of excess (Neil Kenny). This essay examines this apparent contradiction by focusing on the Muslim protagonist in one of Miguel de Cervantes’s plays that takes place on the Spanish–North African borderlands. In Los baños de Argel (1615), Zahara defends her desire to inquire about the world by portraying herself as a “curious impertinent” (“curiosa impertinente”), a name that clearly recalls the tale of “El curioso impertinente” intercalated in the first part of Don Quixote (1605). Moreover, Zahara harnesses her ability to ask questions to further her goals and ambitions. Ultimately, through a close reading of the female protagonist in this play, I argue that Cervantes considers the ways in which women asserted their own curiosity and represented themselves as agents of inquiry.'}	0	https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/14/2/28	2	dict	https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/	https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

This study was conducted to document migraine synonyms in this population.\r\nMethods: A 5-year retrospective study was conducted in three outpatient clinics in a coastal region of Southern India. When children were brought with recurrent headaches, as an aid to diagnosing migraines, family history of headache or migraine was recorded from their mothers and grandmothers. They were asked two questions - 1) do you get headaches or 2) suffered from headaches in the past. If they replied in the negative, a third question was asked (Do you get any head discomfort /head pain along with any other illness).\r\nResults: Out of 7000 mothers and grandmothers interviewed, 1778 reported headache in the past resembling migraine or probable migraine. 1001 who said no headache in the past, were getting other migraine synonym disorders in which headache was one of the complaints. 22 different synonyms which fitted into migraine diagnostic features were documented in this group of study participants.\r\nConclusions: To diagnose migraine and its subtypes, 2 (aura) to 5 (without aura) past episodes are mandatory. This study proves that a sound knowledge about local migraine synonyms and slangs are important to elicit past history of migraine. Headache epidemiological studies can be flawed if only one leading question like do you get headaches/suffered from headache in the past is asked.'}	0	https://www.msjonline.org/index.php/ijrms/article/view/11802	2	dict	no license	no license

A microplasma jet was generated by the nanosecond trigger pulse and injected into the follow-up breakdown gap of the gas switch to decrease the working coefficient. The influence of capillary parameters on the development of the microplasma jet was simulated. The results showed that the microplasma jet significantly reduced the breakdown delay time, jitter, and working coefficient. Increasing the capillary length and decreasing the diameter results in better triggered breakdown performance. Furthermore, the gas switch triggered by a positive pulse exhibits a lower breakdown delay and jitter. Combined with the intensified charge coupled device’s shooting results, it can be concluded that the microplasma jet has a distinct influence on streamer formation, which is important for improving the working performance of the gas switch.'}	0	https://pubs.aip.org/rsi/article/95/8/083302/3306475/A-novel-micro-capillary-discharge-plasma-jet	2	dict	no license	no license

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a 3 day titration diet, providing known quantities of iodized salt, is reflected in 24 h urinary iodine concentration (UIC), serum iodine, and thyroglobulin (Tg). Methods: A total of 10 participants (31.3 ± 4.0 years, 76.1 ± 6.3 kg) completed three, 3 day iodine titration diets (minimal iodine, US RDA, (United States Recommended Daily Allowance), and 3× RDA). The 24 h UIC, serum iodine, and Tg were measured following each diet. The 24 h UIC and an iodine-specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were completed at baseline. Results: UIC increased an average of 19.3 μg/L for every gram of iodized salt consumed and was different from minimal to RDA (p = 0.001) and RDA to 3× RDA diets (p = 0.04). Serum iodine was different from RDA to 3× RDA (p = 0.006) whereas Tg was not responsive to diet. Baseline UIC was associated with iodine intake from milk (r = 0.688, p = 0.028) and fish/seafood (r = 0.646, p = 0.043).
