Title: Metadata-based Data Exploration with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models
Abstract: Developing the capacity to effectively search for requisite datasets is an urgent requirement to assist data users in identifying relevant datasets considering the very limited available metadata. For this challenge, the utilization of third-party data is emerging as a valuable source for improvement. Our research introduces a new architecture for data exploration which employs a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance metadata-based data discovery. The system integrates large language models (LLMs) with external vector databases to identify semantic relationships among diverse types of datasets. The proposed framework offers a new method for evaluating semantic similarity among heterogeneous data sources and for improving data exploration. Our study includes experimental results on four critical tasks: 1) recommending similar datasets, 2) suggesting combinable datasets, 3) estimating tags, and 4) predicting variables. Our results demonstrate that RAG can enhance the selection of relevant datasets, particularly from different categories, when compared to conventional metadata approaches. However, performance varied across tasks and models, which confirms the significance of selecting appropriate techniques based on specific use cases. The findings suggest that this approach holds promise for addressing challenges in data exploration and discovery, although further refinement is necessary for estimation tasks.
