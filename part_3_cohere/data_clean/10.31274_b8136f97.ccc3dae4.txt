Title: Comparing Funder Metadata in OpenAlex and Dimensions
Abstract: I often need to look at metadata for scholarly articles that acknowledge a particular funding agency or group of  agencies. I wanted to compare the results from OpenAlex, a free and open scholarly database that provides  metadata under a CC0 license, and Dimensions, a paid database we have a site license to here at Iowa State  University (note: Dimensions also offers a free version, but with limited features that do not include a Funder  filter).  Funder metadata tends to get into scholarly databases in two ways. It can be provided by publishers when  registering a work for a DOI, or it can be inferred from analyzing an article’s Acknowledgements section.  Unfortunately, the funder metadata field is an optional value at DOI registration, so it is often left blank.  OpenAlex uses Crossref as a major building block in its dataset, with the general consequence that if Crossref  doesn’t have it, OpenAlex won’t see it. By contrast, Dimensions analyzes an article’s Acknowledgements  section using natural language processing to infer funders and enrich the metadata coming from Crossref. It  also has agreements with publishers to obtain additional funding information.
